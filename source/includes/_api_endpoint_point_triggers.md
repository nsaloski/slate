Edit a new point trigger. Note that this supports PUT or PATCH depending on the desired behavior.

**PUT** creates a point trigger if the given ID does not exist and clears all the point trigger information, adds the information from the request. Point Trigger events will be also deleted if not present in the request.
**PATCH** fails if the point trigger with the given ID does not exist and updates the point trigger field values with the values point trigger the request.

#### HTTP Request

To edit a point trigger and return a 404 if the point trigger is not found:

`PATCH /points/triggers/ID/edit`

To edit a point trigger and create a new one if the point trigger is not found:

**Post Parameters**

Same as [Get Point Trigger](#get-point-trigger). Point Trigger events can be created/edited via the point triggers event arrays placed in the point trigger array.

#### Response

If `PUT`, the expected response code is `200` if the point trigger was edited or `201` if created.
